Dictionary API
This is my Dictionary API.
Here, we were assigned, with vague instructions, to create a front-end application over the course of two days.  
Students generally had free reign to choose whatever they wanted to do, except the project MUST have:

1. INTERACTION: Must have at least one event listener.
2. AJAX: Must have at least one AJAX call to an API.
3. DOM: Must manipulate the DOM based on a userâ€™s interaction with your app.
4. POLISH: Your application should look clean and finished.

I have created a dictionary application, using a free API I found online.
In the application, users can type in any english word, and information will be appended to the DOM and display on the screen.
There are external links, as well as a navigation bar.
